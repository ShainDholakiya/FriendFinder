### Overview

A compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results from users' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

I used Express to handle routing and deployed my app to Heroku so other users can fill it out.
